#Mixed Messages Portfolio Project

###The Goal

To build a JavasScript app that prints a random message to a user every time it runs.

This is a component of the module 'Software Development Foundation' of my 'Backend Engineering Path' at Codecademy.

####The engineer's thought process

1. **Visualizing the end result:**
* Every time the app runs - user clicks a button at the DOM - there's a quote about an expert talking about how to transition successfully to engineering.
* The application uses HTML and CSS to display the app to a browser. 
* The app uses JS to create the mechanism that selects a random quote and brings it back to the user.
* the files are created in my directory and stored in Github.

2. **My key questions**
* How to display an HTML file from GitHub to a web browser (I don't plan to host it in any domain right now)
* How to create a relative path from an HTML file to a CSS and JS file inside GitHub

3. **The plan**
>A. Create a list of 20 quotes from experts about starting another career into software engineering. 20 min
>B. Create a repository to store my project in GitHub. 30 min
>C. Create draft HTML, CSS and JS files in my repository. 15 min
>D. Create the JS feature that responds to an element click by picking a random quote and returning it to the browser. 45 min
>E. Create the HTML file that will display the code. 30 min
>F. Create the reference CSS stylesheet. 15 min
>G. Test the app. 15 min
>H. Delete the local directory. 15 min

This project will take approximately 5 to 8 hours to be completed.

4. **The Action**
A. The list of 20 quites from experts about starting a new career into software engineering?
